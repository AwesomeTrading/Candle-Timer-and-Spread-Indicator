# Candle Timer and Spread Indicator

Candle Timer and Spread is an indicator for MT4 and MT5 by EarnForex.com. It supports three views: basic, detailed, and symbol info. In its basic form, it shows a small panel with a countdown till the next candle on the chart. Other views let you get some additional information, like elapsed time or spread size.

You can customize the panel to your liking and receive alerts when only certain time is left until the next candle.
